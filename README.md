This is a very early version of the extension that only works with https://youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips. There will be more places that the titles are replaced soon!

Supported browsers:

Brave ✅
Chrome ✅

## Installation instructions

Download the appropriate release package for your browser. Unzip the file to a folder and then follow the approriate instructions for your browser.
